<h2>Description</h2>
Mitigate is a physical card game, that is currently being made in web form. It is a card game teaching young entrepeneurs and business owners
about the risks that may surface in the business world and how to <strong>mitigate</strong> them. Our goal with this project is to make a fully working game with a pleasing design. 
The UI and cards are fully designed by us.
